## Basic clusering methods

This repository gathers a few projects, meant to explore basic clustering techniques (unsupervised learning).

Two jupyter notebooks detail the implementation of classic algorithms:

* K-means algorithm applied to the iris dataset (project in Python)

* EM algorithm applied to synthetic data, distributed according to a bidimensional gaussian mixture (project in R)

A third notebook, "Co-clustering for NLP", details the implementation and the limits related to a co-clustering algorithm applied to matrix data related to Natural Language Processing, following the paper
